             application users to download climate data of a pre-specified region within any watershed across the globe. The weather data can be downloaded in 
             multiple hydrologic model compatible formats including SWAT, HEC-HMS and generic CSV format for compatibility with other hydrologic models, including
             GR4J and Machine Learning based rainfall runoff models. W3S can thus be considered a global weather data playgoround designed to swiftly assist users
